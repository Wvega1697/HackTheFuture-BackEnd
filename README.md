# EcoIndustry - HackTheFuture-BackEnd

EcoIndustry is a company committed to reducing its carbon footprint in its production process. To achieve this goal, the company has implemented innovative techniques in its industrial facilities. As part of its strategy, EcoIndustry needs to collect detailed information from all factory areas from January 2022 to December 2022. This data collection process is essential for identifying critical areas where energy consumption can be reduced and the emission of polluting gases can be decreased. At EcoIndustry, we are dedicated to environmental care and constantly work towards achieving a more sustainable and planet-friendly production process.

## Project Infrastructure

A non-relational database was used, created in Firebase.

The code was developed using Java 11 with Spring Boot and Maven.

The project's structure type is Layered Packages.

## "ConsumeObject" Type Object

"ConsumeObject" type objects are used to record and generate reports within the API. These objects are stored in the non-relational Firebase database.

### Structure of "ConsumeObject" Type Objects

| Value | Description | Data Type |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| internalId* | ID to reference consumption. Created by concatenating the NUM-MONTH_TYPE_CATEGORY. | String |
| description | Allows adding a description to the consumption. | String |
| type | Defines the type of consumption. | Type |
| emissionType | Defines the emission segment of the consumption. | EmissionType |
| categoryType | Defines the category of consumption. | CategoryType |
| unitOfMeasure | Defines the unit of measure for consumption. | UnitOfMeasure |
| quantity | Establishes the quantity consumed in the month. | int |
| month | Defines the month of consumption. | Month |
| subType | Defines the subtype of consumption. | SubType |

*In addition to the internalId, Firebase creates a unique ID when adding the document to the collection.
